# Provisioning

An Ansible role to ease the task of onboarding accounts into CyberArk's Core Privileged Access Security (PAS) using CyberArk's Management API.

## Requirements

Ansible >= v2.5

## Role Variables

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```ansible
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
```
